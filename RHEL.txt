To list all the enabled services on a Red Hat Linux system, you can use the systemctl command. Here's how:

1. List All Enabled Services
    systemctl list-unit-files --type=service | grep enabled
    This command displays all services and their states, filtering only the ones marked as enabled.

2. (Optional) List Currently Active Services
If you want to see the services that are actively running:

    systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running
Explanation
    list-unit-files: Shows all unit files and their states (enabled, disabled, etc.).
    grep enabled: Filters to display only the enabled services.



1. Locate the Unit File
    Use the systemctl command to find where the unit file for shinyproxy.service is located:

    systemctl show shinyproxy.service -p FragmentPath
    This command will display the full path to the unit file (e.g., /etc/systemd/system/shinyproxy.service).
3. Check the Status
    You can also check the status of the service to ensure it's running correctly:

    systemctl status shinyproxy.service
4. Validate the Unit File
    To ensure the shinyproxy.service unit file has no syntax errors:

    systemctl daemon-reload
